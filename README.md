# HTB-WriteUps

Here I will be posting personal writeups for various retired Hack the Box machines. The PDF files are more detailed and aesthetically pleasing, while also following a more educational approach. The Markdown files are faster to read and more straightforward, containing simply the steps I followed to capture the flag.

Thank you for reading and have a pleasant day!
